        <p>The Junior Birding Society plays a key role in bridging the gap between the youth and birding. A study in the prestigious journal Nature titled, “Initial Involvement into birding: triggers, gender, and decade effects-a mixed-methods study” analyzed statistics regarding the ages of birders. Birders typically begin bird watching at the age of 23, with an average age of 46 among avid birders. Our goal is to make birding more accessible to elementary and middle school students by breaking down the walls that make birding so inaccessible: a steep learning curve and a lack of exposure. We plan to use resources such as Merlin and eBird to increase the accessibility and engagement in birding. Through our outreach programs and events, we are trying to give students the opportunity to see the world through the lens of both a birder and a scientist.</p>
          <br><br>
        <h2>We want to inspire a whole new generation of birders and scientists.</h2>
